# 06-Weather-Dashboard

## Description

This is a weather dashboard application to show the current and future weather conditions for a specific city which is entered by the user and the city then gets added to the search history so that the user can select it next time. The application displays the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed and the UV index of the current day and the temperature, the humidity and the wind speed for the next 5 days.  

## How does it work:

    * The application uses the OpenWeather API to fetch the weather data for a city.

    * The data is then stored in local storage.

    * The user enters a city name in the search box and clicks the search icon and the right side shows the weather conditions for the current day and the next 5 days.

    * The city is stored in the local storage as search history and the user can select it later to view the data again.
